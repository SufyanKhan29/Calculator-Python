## 🛠️ How It Works
### 1️⃣ Personal Info Function
This function asks for the user’s name and then prints predefined details about them.
```python
 def info():
     user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
     print(f"My name is: {user_input}")
     print("I am from Peshawar")
     print("I belong to the Dawudzai tribe")
     print("I like to work on technical projects")
```

### 2️⃣ Calculator Function
The program provides the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

It continuously runs until the user chooses to exit.
```python
while run:
    user_choice = int(input("Choose an operation: "))
    usernum1 = int(input("Enter first value: "))
    usernum2 = int(input("Enter second value: "))
```
